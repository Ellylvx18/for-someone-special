            <p>My Dearest Cutie,</p>
            <p><br>I know you said to me not to work too hard for a gift for you but I just can’t help myself. The why I called all of that a project is simply because it is my first time making a website for someone and personally. I like web development even if it’s pretty hard… I wanted to make you happy, smiling during this day. You deserve all my love since you’re driving my heart wild. I love you, but the words aren’t enough to express what I truly feel. I try to be better for you, to be here and go to school more often for my dream.</p>
            <p><br>In just a few days, it will be two months since we’ve been together, and you’ve made me feel things I hadn’t really had the time to experience before. It feels like I’ve known you for years, and that’s such a comforting thought. Over these two months, you’ve made me laugh, cry, smile from ear to ear, and so much more. But most of all, you’ve made me feel loved in a way I never thought I would… to feel loved by another heart besides my own. All I want right now is to never lose you because you mean so much to me.</p>
            <p><br>When I say you mean so much to me, I proved it to you by opening up to you a week ago. I rarely confide in anyone, but when I do, take it as a very good sign. I trust you, and I hope you do too. If I could, I’d give you the moon just to see you smile with all your teeth showing.</p>
            <p><br>You know what I dream about? Well, I dream being rich and being next to you, hugging you, kissing you, spoiling you and your family... I also want to take care of you when you’re sick. I’ll hold you like my precious person in the world. You truly mean something to me.</p>
            <p><br>Even if sometimes you take time to reply, I’m not mad. You have a life, you have a family and your own dreams. It would be with pleasure I’ll help you succeeding. Love isn’t only loving someone or cherishing them. It’s also taking care of this person you love and encouraging this person to go forward, to push themselves further.</p>
            <p><br>The way you support me is cute. And yes I find everything about you cute. Except your late answers but I truly understand.</p>
            <p><br>Even when I’m tolling as a guy on roblox, you keep joining me and I love you for that too. No, really, this isn’t only for that but 1% of it or less. I love you because you’re kind to me, you make me smile and light up my mood when I’m falling down once more because of my past. You also motivates me because without you, I wouldn’t be here doing that for you.</p>
            <p><br>I have to say it’s hard to do a website from a to z but I managed to do it. But of course I didn’t do it myself because I only had 2 weeks for that but one week in reality because I started my project 5 times before finding the perfect thing for my skills.</p>
            <p><br>No matter what happen, don’t think bad at yourself, it’s very important for me. You say you’re a bad person, but I don’t believe you are. You are not a bad person—remember this. You’re the one who’s warmed my heart, who makes me smile, laugh, and blush. You’re the one I can confide in, the one I can tell everything to. Maybe I’m doing too much, but in my eyes, I could never do enough for you.</p>
            <p><br>You’re not perfect since nobody is perfect but I ensure you that you’re the kindest man I ever met in my life. Plus, you would have won the Mister international. Just kidding, it’s just a political game.</p>
            <p><br>I hope you’re not getting too tired of me or the distance between us. Despite the distance, I love you with all my heart. No matter who doesn’t love me, if you and your family love me, that’s what matters. I would love to meet your family, to meet you in person, and to finally have your heart. Because for me, without your parents' approval, I wouldn’t say I have your entire heart. I would only say I have a part of it.</p>
            <p><br>I miss you always. I wait patiently for your messages and smile when I see your notification. My feelings are here, no matter the time or the weather.</p>
            <p><br>Anyway, there aren't only this page.</p>
            <p>So, CLICK THE BUTTON CUTIE!!</p>
            <p><br>Live your life to the fullest, cutie.</p>
            <p>Your girlfriend, Elly or Elyse for my real name if I didn't tell you already.</p>

    <p id="hidden-text" class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">The why i asked you your fav animal is because I want to buy your fav animal. <br> I want to make you happy, no matter what. <br> Seeing you smile is like watching the stars shine in the sky. <br> Your smile is the sun of my life even if I didn't saw you, <br> I know your smile is the prettiest of the whole Earth. <br> I love you and this will never end, <br> Maybe I love you too much but it's better than not loving you right? <br> </p>
